# Umbraco RFCs

The Umbraco RFC (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent way for Umbraco HQ to facilitate the transparency of decisions made for features and changes in Umbraco products.

An Umbraco RFC is a proposal for a significant change or a new feature. 

The RFC process will:

* Facilitate the transparency of decision making by Umbraco HQ to Umbraco end-users.
* Enable individual contributors to help make decisions.
* Allow domain experts to have input in decisions.
* Manage the risk of decisions made.
* Have a snapshot of context for the future.

Please read and respect the __[RFC Code of Conduct](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)__

### [See Active RFCs](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/pulls)

## The Umbraco RFC process

This repository is intended to be used for reviewing submitted RFCs. 

### Process outline

* An RFC [pull request is made](RFC_CREATION.md) by Umbraco HQ and thereby [open for comments](RFC_PROCESS.md#Reviewing).
* The RFC may may be [updated, closed or restarted if necessary](RFC_PROCESS.md#Updating) by the Author if they choose to.
* When Umbraco HQ decides to finalize the RFC, it will be tagged for final comments and a deadline will be provided.
* At the provided deadline the [RFC will be accepted or closed](RFC_PROCESS.md#Acceptance) by Umbraco HQ.
* [Implementation](RFC_PROCESS.md#Implementation) may begin.
